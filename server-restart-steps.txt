How to Manually Restart the Localhost Server
=========================================

IMPORTANT - Before Starting:
--------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project directory using:
   Command: cd C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Home-Estimate-insurance
   (This is your project's root directory where package.json is located)

1. Stop all Node.js processes
---------------------------
Command: taskkill /F /IM node.exe

Expected outputs:
- Success message: if Node.js was running and got terminated
- "FEHLER: Der Prozess 'node.exe' wurde nicht gefunden" (German) or
  "ERROR: The process 'node.exe' was not found" (English)
  â†’ This is OK! It just means no Node.js process was running

2. Clean Next.js cache
---------------------
Command: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
This removes the Next.js cache directory to ensure a clean restart.
The -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue flag prevents errors if the directory doesn't exist.

3. Start the development server
----------------------------
Command: npm run dev
This starts the Next.js development server on port 3010.
You should see output indicating the server is running:
- Local: http://localhost:3010
- Network: http://0.0.0.0:3010

Additional Tips:
--------------
- ALWAYS make sure you see your project files when you run 'dir' or 'ls'
- You should see files like package.json, next.config.js in your directory
- If you're not in the right directory, the commands won't work
- To check if you're in the right place, look for these key files:
  * package.json
  * next.config.js
  * src/ folder
  * .env file

How to Check Your Location:
-------------------------
1. In CMD/PowerShell, type 'pwd' to see current directory
2. Type 'dir' (CMD) or 'ls' (PowerShell) to list files
3. Make sure you see the files listed above

Common Issues:
------------
1. "Port already in use": Run the taskkill command to free up the port
2. "Module not found": Run npm install to reinstall dependencies
3. "Cannot find module 'next'": Run npm install next to install Next.js
4. "Command not found": You're probably in the wrong directory
5. "Process not found" when running taskkill: This is normal if server wasn't running

Remember: These steps should be performed in order, and make sure to wait for each command to complete before moving to the next one.

Quick Directory Check:
-------------------
If lost, copy and paste this command:
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Home-Estimate-insurance
