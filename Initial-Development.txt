Initial Development Plan

Core Technology Stack:

Computer Vision: YOLO or Faster R-CNN for object detection
Mobile Development: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform capability
Backend: Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) for processing and API handling
Database: Firebase or MongoDB for storing user data and detection results


MVP Features:

Room scanning with smartphone camera
Basic furniture and electronics detection
Estimated value calculation based on detected items
Simple report generation for insurance documentation


Development Phases:
Phase 1: Proof of Concept

Implement basic object detection for common household items
Create simple UI for camera functionality
Develop price estimation algorithm using public pricing databases

Phase 2: Core App Development

Improve detection accuracy for a wider range of items
Build comprehensive UI/UX with guided scanning process
Implement report generation and export features

Phase 3: Refinement and Expansion

Add machine learning to improve estimates based on brand, quality, condition
Implement 3D room scanning for better context
Develop partnerships with insurance companies for direct integration



Implementation Challenges
Several technical challenges you'll need to address:

Object Recognition Accuracy: Distinguishing between similar items of different value (e.g., IKEA vs. designer furniture)
Price Estimation: Creating a reliable database of average prices that accounts for condition, age, and regional variations
Usability: Making the scanning process intuitive while ensuring comprehensive coverage
Privacy Concerns: Handling sensitive data about home contents and value securely

Monetization Options

Freemium model with basic detection free, detailed reports as premium
Insurance company partnerships and referrals
Subscription model for ongoing home inventory management
